# Nashville-pollen

Power BI project to show pollen variation over the last few decades

Scroll through the years and see how the pollen has increased over the months year after year.  Warmer temperatures lead to longer growing seasons.  Pollen has increased year after year, with ragweed having a much larger presence in later years, whereas it was non-existent in the first year 2001.  Later years show increased risk for sensitive groups.
